<h2>Introductions</h2>
<p>This is a website for research on bioluminescence. This article explains how bioluminescence was made and who discovered it. It's a summary of all you need to know about bioluminecence.</p>

<h3>Visual of bioluminescence</h3>

<b><h3>Findings and How Bioluminscence is made</h3></b>
<p>Luminescence was first discovered in 1500 BCE but clarified in 1877. Bioluminescence is caused by a collision of two chemicals. The two required chemicals are luciferin and luciferase/photoprotein. Some sea creatures produce their own luciferin, while others absorb it instead. Luciferin creates a byproduct called oxyluciferin, which produces light.</p>

<b><h3>Where Bioluminscence is Found</h3></b>
<p>Bioluminescence is used by creatures to lure prey and hunt them down, defend predators, find mates, and so on. It helps defend predators by startling, confusing, and delaying them when least expected. In daylight, some marine animals with bioluminescence use this to hide from sharks, since sharks look up. These animals can control how much light they produce. </p>
